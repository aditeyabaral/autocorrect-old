Machine learning is the scientific study of . F algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions , relying on patterns and reference instead . It is seen as a subset of astiffrcial intelligence . Machine leading algorithms build a mathematical model lugt a sample data known as training . Machine learning algorithms ase used in a variety of applications . such as email filtering and computes vision where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a . Conventional algosiltm for effectively performing the task is # . B 3 #
